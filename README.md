In this project, titled "Implementation of Genetic Programming to Build a Classifier for the Diabetes Dataset," we explored the use of evolutionary computation techniques to address the challenges of accurate and interpretable medical diagnosis classification. Utilizing a subset of the widely recognized Diabetes dataset, our goal was to optimize a genetic programming (GP) model that not only excels in classification accuracy but also maintains computational efficiency and model simplicity. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, including normalization and encoding, to prepare the dataset for effective use within our genetic programming framework. We leveraged the DEAP library to implement our GP model, focusing on defining a robust fitness function that prioritizes high classification accuracy while penalizing excessive model complexity, thus preventing overfitting and ensuring generalizability.

Our methodology was rooted in a systematic experimental design where various configurations of GP parameters were meticulously tested. Key parameters such as population size, mutation rates, crossover probabilities, and tree depth constraints were adjusted in a series of trials to find the optimal balance between exploration and exploitation. This process was crucial in developing a GP model that adapts and evolves across generations to improve its performance iteratively. The experimentation phase included the use of statistical analysis to benchmark the model's effectiveness across different metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, alongside classification accuracy. Each set of trials was conducted multiple times to ensure reliability and consistency of the results, with performance peaks being assessed through internal validation and subsequently through a public Kaggle competition which provided a real-world testing ground for our classifier.

The final model exhibited significant improvements over baseline classifiers, with classification accuracies surpassing the initial targets set at the project's outset. This success was attributed to the fine-tuned balance of genetic programming operations and the strategic limitation of tree complexity, which together fostered a highly interpretable and scalable model. The project not only demonstrated the applicability of genetic programming in handling complex classification problems but also contributed valuable insights into enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of evolutionary computation techniques in practical applications. Our findings underscore the potential of genetic programming to revolutionize fields requiring robust, accurate, and interpretable analytical models, paving the way for future research and application in broader contexts.
